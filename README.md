## How to set it up
To make this demo work, you will need to:
1. Clone this repository and open it as a Godot Project 
2. Follow the instructions at [https://github.com/GodotNuts/GodotFirebase](GodotFirebase) to download and install the addon
3. Download the Firebase-UI folder from [https://github.com/GodotNuts/GodotFirebase-UI](GodotFirebase-UI) and paste it into the root level of your project.
4. Run. The project. Run the project.


This is meant to be a very small chat app - limited to 12 characters per chat. :D The only reason that's the case is that it was potentially going to be a submission to a game jam that forced you to be only 84x84 resolution. In addition to this, it was for Nokia, so that's why the color scheme. The idea, though, is to understand the code, so that's why it doesn't matter how weird the idea behind OneBitChat is: it just works.
